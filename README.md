# LBYARCH
Lbyarch x86-to-C interface programming project

The program is done under the requirement of LBYARCHâ€™s MP2 with the following specs:

## The C Program

The C program allows the calling of both C and assembly kernels. The C program also tracks both the average time and number of execution of each kernel. We tested it using 3 vectors. 2^20, 2^24, and 2^29 as 2^30 was too much to handle for my computer. The sanity check done to see the correctness of both the C and assembly programs is if both programs have the same answer. The average time is calculated by executing each kernel 30 times.
