# LBYARCH
Lbyarch x86-to-C interface programming project

The program is done under the requirement of LBYARCHâ€™s MP2 with the following specs:

## The C Program

The C program allows the calling of both C and assembly kernels. The C program also tracks both the average time and number of execution of each kernel. 

We tested it using 3 vectors. 2^20, 2^24, and 2^29 as 2^30 were too much to handle for my computer.

The sanity check done to see the correctness of both the C and assembly programs is if both programs have the same answer. The average time is calculated by executing each kernel 30 times.

## Kernel Comparison and Analysis

DEBUG AVERAGE TIME COMPARISON OF C AND ASM
|  TEST  |  C AVERAGE TIME  |  ASSEMBLY AVERAGE TIME  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  2^20  |  0.002633 seconds  |  0.000833 seconds  |
|  2^24  |  0.043700 seconds  |  0.012100 seconds  |
|  2^29  |  1.422933 seconds  |  0.039233 seconds  |

The average time for the assembly kernel is generally faster than its C counterpart. As the test variables grow arbitrarily large, the time it takes to complete the program rises as well, but there is a significant period between the time it takes for the C kernel to finish and its assembly counterpart. The comparison shows that the performance of the assembly kernel outperforms its C counterpart. However, taking into consideration the readability and complexity of the written codes, the assembly kernel is more prone to errors than its C counterpart.
